## Overview

Camome does not include client-side form validation functionality using JavaScript. Instead, it focuses on easily generating semantic and accessible HTML.

By using the FormField component, you can automatically generate ids and properly link <label> and <input>, as well as include explanatory text (including errors) and mark them up in an accessible way using the aria-describedby attribute.

Since Camome aims to provide HTML-based APIs as much as possible without using JavaScript, it can easily be combined with existing form libraries like [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).
