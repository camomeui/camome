## Overview

Since all of Camome's design tokens (colors, fonts, radii, etc.) are managed with [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*), it is easy to customize the appearance for each brand.

Camome also supports dark theme from the beginning.

## Default Theme

The default theme file can be imported from `@camome/system/theme.css` or `@camome/system.theme.min.css`. If you don't need to customize it, use it directly.

## Configuration File

If you want to change the theme, create a `camome.config.js` file in the project root and set it up like this:

```tsx:camome.config.js
import { defineTheme } from "@camome/system";

/** @type { import("@camome/system").Config;} */
export default {
  themes: {
    light: defineTheme("light", (theme) => ({
      color: {
        // Change primary color to purple
        primary: {
          0: "#faf5ff",
          1: "#f3e8ff",
          2: "#e9d5ff",
          3: "#d8b4fe",
          4: "#c084fc",
          5: "#a855f7",
          6: "#9333ea",
          7: "#7e22ce",
          8: "#6b21a8",
          9: "#581c87",
        },
      },
      // Component-level theme
      Switch: {
        bgOn: theme.color.success.emphasis,
        bgOff: theme.color.danger.emphasis,
        fontOff: theme.color.font.onEmphasis,
      },
    })),
    // For dark theme
    dark: defineTheme("dark"),
  },
};
```

In this example, the primary color is changed to purple, so custom accent colors are applied to all components such as buttons and checkboxes at once.

`Switch` properties are an example of component-level themes. Many components use generic tokens such as `color.<color-scheme>.<variant>...`, so there is no need to set them individually, but complex components have their own tokens.

<Message status="info">
  For example, `<Button colorScheme="danger" variant="solid" />` uses
  `color.danger.solid.bg` and so on, and these are also shared with things like
  `<Tag colorScheme="danger" variant="solid" />
  `. Currently, it is not possible to change these individually for each component
  (mainly to keep the size of global CSS small).

## Camome CLI

You can use Camome CLI to generate a custom theme with the definition of the configuration file.

```bash
npx camome theme
```

The following options are available:

- `--output`: Path of CSS generation destination (default is `theme.css`)
- `--config`: Path of configuration file (default is `camome.config.js`)

<Message status="info">
  `--watch` Mode and integration with bundlers are under consideration.
  Currently, please run the command each time you change the theme.
</Message>

## Overriding Components

At the top of Camome's `theme.css`, the priority of [CSS Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) is declared as follows:

```css
@layer cmm.reset, cmm.theme, cmm.base, cmm.components;
```

Thanks to this line, CSS styles declared after `theme.css` will be prioritized regardless of specificity (as long as they are not inside the above mentioned layer). Creating a layer like `cmm.custom` is optional.

```css:globals.css
/* Override styles of Button
   (Outside of @layer always wins over inside) */
.Button {
  border-radius: 999px;
}

/* Optional */
@layer cmm.custom {...}
```

## Dark theme

Camome supports both `light` and `dark` themes, which can be specified by the `data-theme` attribute of the `<html>` tag.

```html:index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-theme="<light or dark>">
  <!-- Content -->
</html>
```

It is defined as follows in `theme.css`:

```css:theme.css
@layer cmm.theme {
  :root[data-theme="light"] {
    --cmm-color-primary-font: var(--cmm-color-primary-7);
    --cmm-color-primary-emphasis: var(--cmm-color-primary-6);
    {...}
  }
}
```

If you need to style for each theme in your application's CSS, write it as follows:

```css
:root[data-theme="dark"] .your-class {
  /* Your styles for dark theme... */
}
```

<Message status="info">
  **`light` and `dark` can be customized independently.** Please refer to the
  [configuration file](#configuration-file) section.
