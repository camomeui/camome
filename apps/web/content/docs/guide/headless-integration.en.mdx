## Overview

`@camome/core` is primarily written in HTML and CSS, so complex UI's that require JavaScript, like popups, are not supported by default. Components such as [Tab](https://chat.openai.com/docs/components/data-display/tab) and [Menu](https://chat.openai.com/docs/components/overlay/menu) provide HTML and CSS styles, but are essentially just templates, so it is up to the user to make them functional.

However, since this can be cumbersome, it is recommended to use a headless UI library that takes care of the non-visual aspects of the components, so the user doesn't have to.

For React, some popular libraries include:

- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)
- [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/)

For components that require integration with an external library, sample codes using [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) are provided in the documentation. Of course, other libraries or writing your own code is also possible.

  As the author is a React user, I am not familiar with other framework or
  vanilla JavaScript headless UI libraries. If you know of any, please submit a
  PR.
