## What is Camome UI

Camome UI is a **React component library and a CSS framework**.

## Features

### Lightweight bundle size

For example, the `Button` of [`@mui/material@5.11.6`](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@mui/material@5.11.6) is **16.9KB** on its own, and Emotion and ThemeProvider are added to it.

On the other hand, Camome UI's [`Button`](https://chat.openai.com/docs/components/inputs/button) is lightweight, **1.42KB** (including CSS), and an additional 4KB of global CSS is added to it.

  Camome UI imports CSS Modules within the distribution package and is not
  calculated by bundlephobia, so we are [analyzing
  it](https://github.com/camomeui/camome/blob/4cef229a074c05d437e65abb9a1b62286f131598/apps/web/scripts/gen-docs-data.ts#L124).

### CSS first & no JS runtime

Camome UI uses [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for styling, so there is no load of runtime for styling like [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

Also, since no event handlers or `useEffect` are used at all, it can also be used as a pure CSS framework as described later. For complex UIs such as <DocLink id="menu"/> and <DocLink id="tab"/>, please consider <DocLink id="guide:headless-integration"/>.

### Dark mode and custom theme

It is compatible with dark mode by default. It is also possible to customize the theme. For details, please refer to <DocLink id="guide:theming"/>.

### Guaranteed style override

One drawback of CSS Modules is that "it is difficult to override styles". For example, all components of Camome UI accept the `className` prop, and this is combined with the default class name with [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx). As a result, an attribute such as `class="Button custom-class"` is added, but there is no guarantee that the latter class will win in normal situations. This is a problem.

However, **Camome UI supports [CSS Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer), so it can be overridden certainly**. For more information, please refer to <DocLink id="guide:theming" hash="overriding-components" />.

### Accessible

It may not be perfect, but accessibility is paid attention to as much as possible.

For example, the <DocLink id="switch"/> is implemented only with CSS, but it still allows for focus and switching by keyboard, and the <DocLink id="accordion"/> also supports opening and closing without client-side JavaScript using the `<details />` element. Also, each `<input />`-related component has been made easy to set appropriate `label` and `aria-describedby` attributes using `<FormField />` (see: <DocLink id="guide:form"/>).

### Portable

It is primarily designed for use as a React library, but it can also be used as a CSS framework like Bootstrap by importing bundled CSS.

This means that it is not dependent on the React ecosystem, so it should be easy to port to other frameworks like Vue or Svelte.
