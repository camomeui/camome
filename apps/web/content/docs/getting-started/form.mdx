## Overview

Camome doesn't provide built-in features that enable form validation or submission by client-side JavaScript.

Instead, we focus on helping you build semantic and accessible HTML by `FormControl` component that automatically publishes `id`s and ties them to appropriate `<label>`s and `<input>`s. It also supports adding descriptive text (including errors) that's defined as [`aria-describedby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby) attribute.

As Camome follows the Web standard and exports the HTML-based APIs, it can be easily integrated with existing form libraries such as [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).
